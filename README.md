# Goals
Our four dragons, __Yellow__, __Green__, __Blue__ and __Red__, have been kept prisonners by the ruthless __El Loco__. They now have to climb his infernal tower in order to escape this hell.

# How the game works
Since the dragons are bonded by the dragon's pact, they move together. This means for instance that when __Yellow__ goes left, __Green__ goes left too, and so on.

They have to escape each rooms by opening the door relative to their side. To do that, they have to open a chest which will release a key. They finally have to collect this key in order to open the door which will allow them to set them free.
